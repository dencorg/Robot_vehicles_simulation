Student project in C++
---

Simulation of robotic resource gathering vehicles on an alien unknown world.
The vehicles may be damaged when moving around the world.
Vehicles variables are: speed, state (broken or not) and the access capability
(how possible it is to brake during movement).
The ground spots have indications of how dangerous is to get to them.

There are three kinds of vehicles:
- Analyse vehicles (vehicles that mine the resources)
- Discover vehicles (vehicles that put flags on to indicate dangerous ground spots in the world)
- Rescue vehicles (vehicles that repair neighbour damaged vehicles)

The three resources are: 
- Palladio - Palladium
- Iridio - Iridium
- Leukoxrisos - Platinum

This is a student project so watch out :)

Compile by running the make command.
    make
